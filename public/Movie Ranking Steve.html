<h1>The Best Movies According to Steve</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Forest Gump</h3>
<p>I loved this story and the way it was told. The CGI was incredible as well.</p>
<h3>District 9</h3>
<p>This low budget Sci-Fi movie had a relatively unknown cast but was extremly well done. Loved the aliens and the storyline!</p>
<h3>American Psycho</h3>
<p>A comedy-horror staring Christian Bale, it had both great dialogue and grusome scenes</p>
