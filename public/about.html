<h1>About Me:</h1>
 
<p> Hi! I hail from Phoenix, Arizona by way of upstate New York.
    In 2009 I retired to the Philippines and that is where I have resided ever since.</p>

<p> My backround is entraprereural. From 1981 -1991 I was in the Furniture Retail Business.
    I worked from 1981-1982 at a furniture store as a commissioned salesperson and in 1982 
    my partner and I opened our first retail store called Bethany Home Furniture. 
    In the next few years we opened two additional store locations.</p>

<p> Then in 1988 we desolved our partnership and I took over one of the current store locations.
    I renamed the store to Clearance Furniture Showroom. It was a great location right across  
    from a major furniture retailer.  This location turned out to be the most profitable of all three stores.</p>
    
<p> In 1991 I sold my store and co-founded J.Stevens Co, Inc., a upholstered furniture manufacturing
    and wholesale company.  Starting with almost nothing, we built this company up to $4 million dollars 
    in sales per year within just a few years.  My position with the company was President and CEO.
    My job responsibilities were just about everything within the front office.  These duties included
    writing the computer programing to help run the business, taking calls and orders from the retail dealers,
    meeting and ordering from suppliers, cost analysis of materials and labor, processing orders and production schedules,
    all of the basic accounting and payroll through QuickBooks, and everything else associated with running the business except 
    for the actual manufacturing of the product.  That was done by my very talanted partner.</p>
    
<p> Late in 2008 we decided to close our business after a very successful run. The reason for this 
    was due to two factors. The housing market had collapsed in Arizona (and basically nationwide),
    and the cost of raw materials were skyrocketing. Many retailers just couldn't afford to pay for their 
    merchandise or just were unable to stay in business. Due to these reasons I decided to cash out and take
    an early retirement in the beautiful Philippines</p>

 <p>Now retired for over 15 years, I am getting a bit bored and have a strong desire to become productive once again.
    So I am here learning new computer skills to combine with my entraprereural skills and we will see what happens!</p>
